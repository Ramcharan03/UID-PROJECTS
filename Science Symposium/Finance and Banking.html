FINANCE AND BANKING IN AI </P>

<h1>The Indian banking sector’s adoption of artificial intelligence, though in its nascency, has 
seen a steep increase. In the past year, global investment in AI applications touched $5.1 
billion, up from $4.0 billion in 2015.8
 While large commercial and investment banks globally 
are incorporating AI and blockchain for both back-office and customer facing purposes, in 
India, widespread adoption of these technologies has not yet come to fruition.
In the past year, several large financial services companies and FinTech startups have 
collaborated to conduct proof of concepts (POCs) and implement some of these emergent 
technologies into their operations. Though the deployment of AI technologies is still nascent 
in the banking sector, the competitive advantage that the technologies bring has been 
recognized by banks with some developing ‘innovation centres’ and running hackathons - 
these initiatives often take the form of partnerships between banks and FinTech companies.<h1>

<h1>The adoption of AI in the banking and finance sector is a part of the larger digital wave 
occurring within the sector.10 The use and deployment of AI in consumer banking, financial 
products and back-end operations is varied and across different stages of operations. 
Though it is not always clear from publicly available information the exact type of AI 
technology that is being used, some technologies that we did find in our research include: 
Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Generation, Machine Learning (such as 
Neural networks/deep learning), and Computer Vision.</h1>
