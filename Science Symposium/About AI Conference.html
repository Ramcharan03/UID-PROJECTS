<p style="font-size:40px"> ABOUT AI Conference </p>
<h2>
The AI conference will focus on emerging technology in Artificial Intelligence with a specific focus around projects, teams and people who are working on Artificial General Intelligence and related topics. In addition to deeply technical presentations on AI, we will also host presentations on topics in law, ethics, safety, and governance, as we believe those are interesting topics and important dimensions to address in this growing field.

The Artificial Intelligence Conference is produced by the Machine Learning Conference (MLconf), the company and team behind the award winning Machine Learning Conference. Since 2012, MLconf has been working with the top minds in the fields of Machine Learning, AI and Data Science to create a vibrant knowledge sharing community. MLconf began in 2012, as a partnership with Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s GraphLab team, to gather the thought leaders in Machine Learning, specifically Graph Databases. In 2013, MLconf became a separate event, devoted to the Machine Learning and Data Science community in San Francisco, agnostic of any tool, platform or company. In 2014, MLconf entered NYC and Atlanta, as well as San Francisco. In 2015, MLconf hosted conferences in NYC, Atlanta, Seattle and San Francisco and has been hosting events in those cities since. Each year, each event sees growth in numbers of attendance and diversity of attendance, as we welcome more international attendees.

The identification and implementation of a reactive, runtime risk assessment model, facilitating the real-time handling 
of threats and identified risks, for enhancing the security- and privacy-by-design features of the entire ASSURED security
 assurance and data sharing framework through a holistic threat assessment against aspects of such hyper-connected 
SoS. This will enable the dynamic assessment and forecast of individual, cumulative and propagated risks, taking into 
account the representation of assets along with their dependencies, the associated threats and vulnerabilities and the 
potential cascading effects, thus, allowing for enhanced situation awareness adaptation of the entire SoS-enabled ecosystem
 (based on newly identified vulnerabilities and the prediction of unseen cyber threats) supporting policy adjustments and
 the compilation of updated mitigation strategies and attestation policies.
